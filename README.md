# Comprehensive Mental Health Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a mental health dataset using various machine learning and deep learning models. The goal is to classify user inputs related to mental health conditions and casual greetings, enabling the development of chatbots, web-based apps, or mobile apps that can understand and respond to user inputs effectively.

## Project Overview

The analysis includes:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Preprocessing and feature extraction
- Model training and evaluation (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM)
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
- Data augmentation and deployment pipeline suggestions

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various user inputs related to mental health and casual greetings, structured into multiple tags. Each tag represents a different category or condition, such as greetings, mental health issues, and other conversational topics.

The dataset can be found in Kaggle: [Mental Health Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiscecseaiml/mental-health-dataset)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
